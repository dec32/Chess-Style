# Chess Style

Chess Style is a cross-browser extension that allows you to customize your piece set on lichess.org and chess.com.

## Release

- [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/chess-style/)
- Chrome Extension

## Detail

The extension enables users to customize their piece sets sets through:

1. Filling in URLs;
2. Uploading image files;
3. Uploading a folder of images (the add-on will read the names of the images and automatically assign them to their correspond pieces).

When uploading a folder. The file name of an image must contain both the color and piece type. One-letter abbreviations are allowed but when using abbreviations for both color and piece type, they should be written as one word. Words are split by space( ), underscore(_), short dash(-) or dot(.). Take white knight for example, the followings are all legal names:
- `white knight.svg` (recommended);
- `white-knight-256px.png`;
- `w_knight.bmp`;
- `white.n.jiff`;
- `wn_with_shadow.webp`;

The support for chess.com is not fully accomplished, that is to say, the customization won't apply to the homepage.
